# 1. Name:
#      Kevin Gonzalez
# 2. Assignment Name:
#      Lab 06: Advanced Search
# 3. Assignment Description:
#      This program opens the file specified by the user and then prompts the user to enter a word they are searching for in the JSON file. It then checks if the word exists in the array. If it is found, the program displays a "found" message, and if it is not found, it displays a "not found" message.
# 4. Algorithmic Efficiency
#      -I think that is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because each step halves the search range, making it efficient for large datasets.
# 5. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
#      The hardest part was implementing the while loop to return the correct result. Additionally, the last if statement was confusing at times, as it occasionally gave me results I didnâ€™t expect. However, after initializing the variables correctly and making a few adjustments, I was able to get the expected results.
# 6. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
#      3 hours
